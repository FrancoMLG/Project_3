# Project_3
Group 59's repository for COP3530 Project 3

**How to run our code:**

Method 1: Download "Project_3.exe" and "playerList.txt", make sure both are in the same directory, run "Project_3.exe" by double clicking it or by going to the directory it is located in through your command line interface and typing "Project_3".

Method 2: Download "main.cpp" and "playerList.txt", make sure both are in the same directory. Go to your command line interface and go to the directory that has "main.cpp" and "playerList.txt" and type "g++ -o Project_3 main.cpp". Run "Project_3.exe" by either typing "Project_3" in the command line interface in the directory it is located or by double clicking the application. 

**For both methods make sure that "playerList.txt" and "Project_3.exe" are in the same directory before you run the latter.**
